## Coding for Bio : Linux and BASh

This directory includes the scripts for the two projects under the HackBio Career Path Course titled **"Coding for Bio: Linux and BASh"**.


The first project involves basic tasks such as:


- Creating a directory and displaying its contents
- Downloading files and moving them across directories
- Searching through a text file using the commands **"awk"** and **"grep"**
- Viewing a history of commands used and clearing the terminal space.


The second project includes:

- Creating a conda environment named **funtools**
- Configuring conda channels
- Installing packages through the bioconda channel

To run **Project_2.sh**, the command "bash -i Project_2.sh" was utilized to invoke the interactive environment. My attempt to run it in the Shell Cloud resulted in the error "No space left on device", so I resorted to the zsh shell. Theoretically the script should work under bash, too.
